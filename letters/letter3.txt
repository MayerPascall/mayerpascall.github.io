2024-05-30 Happy bithday!

happy birthday! i've been testing out a feature which hides future letters until a certain 'activation date' arrives, but its not really working so you may get these birthday wishes a little early. i think your birthday letter is the perfect place for me to talk about myself, or at least my perspective on some things.

now that we've made it out of college there, obviously, are changes which will occur. i've been locked in to is, as per my last letter, but now the perspective is going to be a more serious one. i foresee that bringing many benefits to us, like having our own homes and being able to decide what we want to do with our own money, having our own free time, and choosing when that free time will be. i have the long term vision in mind when i think about this, and it really brings me joy.

you really bring me joy.

sometimes when we're having a good time doing something fun  together i realize that i am getting infinitely more happiness from watching you enjoy the activity we're doing than the actual doing of it. i notice this of you too reciprocally sometimes, and seeing that behavior in you compounds it in me: im thankful for it.

im really thankful for you.

something i really am thankful about is the specific way that you are able to understand both me and you at the same time
