2024-03-25 Trying out something new

Hopefully I'll have written a second letter before showing you this site, mostly because this would be a dissapointing first letter. If this date doesn't scream anythnig to you, it is the day you sent me my first letter, hopefulyl first of many, and I just told you I had a cool little idea for a medium to send you something back. I do think letters deserve to be handwritten, but I'll make an exception in this case because I think a website with a backlog would be really cool to have.
