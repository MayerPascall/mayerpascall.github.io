2024-03-25 Trying out something new

Hopefully I'll have written a second letter before showing you this site, because I don't intend this first letter to be anything special really. If you don't remember the date, you just sent me my first letter, hopefulyl first of many, and I just told you I had a cool little idea for a medium to send you back a letter. I do think letters deserve to be handwritten, but I'll make an exception in this case because I think a website would be really cool to have.
