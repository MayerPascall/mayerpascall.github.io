merry christmas sej

as a written nickname, i like it. however, spoken outloud its indistinguishable from sage (which i don’t like very much, maybe because rachel kept calling you it). sejoca didn’t really stick at all but i still think its cute. luckily, we’ll soon be together and sej will blur into sage and i will be able to keep up my excuse as to why i don’t use it. consider it just another added benefit to seeing you again:

i miss you. i miss you a lot and it hurts. 

i miss everything: the big moments we have together that will never be forgotten, and the small ones that will.

when you are with me, the gears that move life rotate smoothly. everything works better when i know you’re around and it is noticeable that how i feel throughout the day cycles depending on whether or not i can talk to you. i love being able to talk to you, i always get hit with a gust of happiness whenever the afternoon is shifting into evening and i get your waking up texts on whatsapp. even when i know they’re coming, when you’ve told me that you have an alarm set for 7:30 and i start getting your texts at 7:32, they excite me and fill me with joy. i love talking to you until i fall asleep and i immensely value being able to exchange goodnights; imagine if we had a six hour time gap such that only one of us ever was able to get a true *goodnight* from the other.

even though i value being there to give you a farewell as you receed into your slumber, i can’t help but think “now for the dreaded second half of the day without sejal.”  life is busy and i just want to talk to you. while you are gone, your digital personification has to suffice and fill in the gaps when you aren’t there. i fill up our chats with messages because i have no choice: it is the closest i can get to you during the silent period of the day. there are just a plethora of thoughts and emotions and ideas that i want to share which get relegated to nighttime-text status, almost all of which are bound to be insignificant as they compete with each other for a short bit of attention in the mornings. although, every now and then i remember that my whatsapp background has your butt and it makes me happy.

the pains and struggles of long distance feel as if they accumulate. the happy moments we have on and off call do their best to try and repair the slow and gradual attrition the quiet moments cause us. i like how you're really realistic and don’t sugarcoat things. when something is told by you, it is happening. it is the recognition of this ‘attrition’ that is how we can combat it, we must recognize what is going on te be able to deploy an antidote, and you have always had a keen eye and strong emotional intelligence to be able to perceive and disclose any issues we may risk facing. i am so thankful that you bring this, because it gives me so much confidence in us both in the short term and long term. we face all challenges head on, whether between us or with others.

sleep is such a strange paradox now. i love it because it’s a chance to dream about you. but i do hate it because, for every hour i’m asleep, you’re awake and living moments i’m not there to share. still, one of the best parts of waking up is seeing the texts you’ve sent me, and knowing that, soon, i’ll be able to wake up with you. as i daydream i always return to fond memories of waking up sharing the hollows bed, or in my case waking up as you return to bed, and embracing each others warmth. 

this feeling is made much sweeter knowing that soon, you’ll be in new york and we’ll be reunited again. they do say that the true joy of christmas comes from your loved ones, so i hope you enjoy being able to breath in your room and having unchapped lips
