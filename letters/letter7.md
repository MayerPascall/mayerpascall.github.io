new and improved

i just wanted to show off some new features. 
i lost the desire to do a lot of things, netflix, watching sports, youtube, games. maybe i'm just getting older or something, or maybe i've spent too much time on screens watching things and my body is begging me to do something. so... i decided to put some of that time into making this website a little better. here's some of the new ways i can type:

- # heading
- ## heading but smaller
- ### heading but even smaller
- **bold text** 
- *italic text* 
- ~~strikethrough~~
- `code text 123 function()`

1. numbered list

these are coming from the todo letter i wrote a second ago

i hope you like it. i'm not sure what i'm going to do with it, but i'm going to keep working on it. i hope you're doing well.
