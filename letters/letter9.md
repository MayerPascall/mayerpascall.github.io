we're back

“I hope you look both ways when you cross my mind”
 

I had a dream about you tonight. This is way more common than you'd think. 

We were sitting in the C1 bus with rachel and nic bolton going from west to east, probably to go to their house or something. We were sitting next to eachother facing the two of them and were chatting lightly, but the bus driver had the radio on  so we couldn't hear eachother across the aisle and just ended up having conversations in pairs. I can't really remember moments in dreams all too well, but I can really remember the emotion of warmth and happiness that I felt in this made-up moment that I decided to conjure in my sleep. Even though this memory likely didn't happen, it still feels like it did and it reminds me of one of the things that I love the most about you and our relationship: our great conversations with eachother. I must sound like a broken record at this point, but I'm going to chalk off my repetition as emphasis on this point: you can tell its legit because I was even dreaming about it, even if conversations in dreams are incomprehensible and impossible to remember. That doesn't really matter to me though, remembering the specifics, since I just feel good waking up and thinking of the feelings.

Time after time you ask me to retell my perspective on how I fell in love with you. The other day I saw a tiktok that was really funny which was like “does anybody elses girlfriend always want you to tell her how you fell for her” or something of the sorts, and I was like oh wow maybe you do have a secret second boyfriend. If you do, make sure he doesn't post the relationship or else it'll be easy to get caught. Sometimes I think that maybe you've asked so much that it's seeped into my subconscious and my sleeping self enjoys bringing up this long list of happy moments that we've had together. 

More than once I've had a dream about the night before our first night, when we all went to shooters together and we both realized that something was going on between us, that it would be dangerous for us to be left alone. I've had dreams where we're anywhere, not just Shooters, and I feel that attraction towards you and my mind takes me back a year and a half ago to that feeling that something was up between us and that maybe it was serious. Asleep, I'll be put in a random diner and see you walk in and feel that pull, or get that same feeling when I watch you sit on a train across the aisle from me. I really don't think I can call that night in shooters the first moment that we fell in love, but I do remember you saying quite explicitly that although the first or second hookups were just hookups, there had to be a bit of something there for them to go the way they did. Maybe that could serve as the final answer to your question.

When my mind wanders (daydreaming still fits the theme of this letter) it comes back to one day. It had been so long since I had cried, even longer since the last time I creid from media. Years probably, since I think the most recent moment  I can remember crying was when watching Coco for the first time right after my grandfather died. Evidently, its really rare that a film or show will do that to me, which I think is indicative of how great a find One Day was. I would've never have even watched the trailer if it weren't for your suggestion. Similarly, I would never have touched Dear Zachary but was like absolutely hooked as soon as it started and rode the entire emotional roller coaster throughout the film, albeit I did not cry at the end. You really do have excellent taste, which is quite impressive since you don't hyperfixate on weird esoteric shit like many people with self-proclaimed good taste end up doing.

Sometimes I just dream about being at Duke together doing some random activity here or there.

I've also dreamt about P-checks before, dreaming about the moment when you were in the tent and told Hattie that we were going out. I was able to imagine the moment so vividly in my sleep, even though I was like far as fuck away and blacked out talking to Morgan or some shit. I have no idea if you actually told her while in the tent, but I've reconstructed that whole moment in my head while we sleep. If we're looking to answer the question of 'when did I fall in love' then I think that moment is probably way too late, since I was ready to say it to you that same night. Writing this down right now, I remember coming to this conclusion before the last time you asked me this question.

You really do always ask me to tell you, when was the moment you fell in love?_ I don't know, there's so many.

I would say that falling in love was a bit of a process, and I don't think I'm ever going to get a real moment. When we were on the couch watching modern family and I was freaking out is also probably too late.I think we have to go earlier. Probably to one of those really late nights where I snuck in and we had sex and then talked for hours before you fell asleep and I had to sneak back out. I always had some time to reflect on my thoughts while walking or cycling back home, and despite not being able to identify my feelings in the exact moment, I really did start to feel something special about you. How could I not?

But this led me to the thought, isn't just being in love a process in the same way? These early relationship moments were special but were they any more special than the countless other memorable moments which came afterwards? Why is the question about when I first fell in love and not about the continuous falling-in-love that happens after that? Surely thats whats the most important, since otherwise our relationship would've just been a crush. There's another year and a half of important events that I think are just as special.

Visiting the white house and driving down the national mall was special. Crossing and seeing the Amazon for the first time ever with you is special. Every time we decided to cook together was special. Even that one time we worked out in the gym your parents go to, but then had to dip early after completing a quarter of a workout was special. My phone always reminds me about our visit to Taco Mahal, since it brings up the photos we took there, and that in turn reminds me of our little taco tour in Williamsburg and how fun that was. Could I answer your question by recalling these moments?

Honestly, if I really start thinking about it, little moments like when we were both facetiming while watching Jet Lag and we both fell asleep at different times are also really special. It felt so nice when I woke up and you were still on there and the episode was like 90% finished, although I know it took me forever to eventually watch it again. 

Not to get all cliche or cheesy, but my point here really is that when we spend so long with eachother its hard to just pick out a moment here or there that is particularly more 'special' than the others. I've said that word so many times now that its starting to lose meaning. I am really excited to [see you again](https://open.spotify.com/track/7KA4W4McWYRpgf0fWsJZWB?si=113798e493a440df) (my favorite Tyler, The Creator song, inspired this whole text) and I really can't wait to start the untrackable list of special and intimate moments again. I hope today can be a really special day for you. I love you so much,

Happy birthday!

I tried to write this one a lot more in my own voice, hope it turned out good.
