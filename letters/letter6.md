bye bye letter

hi sejoca

i’m glad i came to durham, i’m so glad you came to new york, and i’m ecstatic that you came down to brazil. 

i miss you cutie

i really enjoyed making the last letter and for a short while became addicted to writing them. i now have a drafts document filled to the brim with a bunch of little paragraphs that i was hoping to unite under some sort of common theme and eventually send to you. inspired by a mysterious book i just picked up which is a collection of stories, i will present these random jumbled ideas in a similar way.

part of the schtik that i have with you is that i want to show you absolutely everything. i like getting to know you a lot, all the little things which when put together make sejal, and i like how you like getting to know me. its very nice to see that you care through all the questions you ask and the effort you put in even to the smallest things. i love how you wanted to engage in formula, i find it very heartwarming that you even considered watching Ferrari (although idk maybe you'd watch that anyways without me), and its so so great when you look at a menu in a restaurant and have a knack for what i would like and what i wouldn’t. ironically, i feel as if we both limit ourselves when i disconsider the red meat options and you disconsider the cheese options because we want to share. its cute tho.

i rarely show people my map games. it is somewhat embarrassing because even though other nerdy aspects of gaming have caught up to general society, maps feel like they’re still a decade behind. i don't really play much nowadays, with the exception of the addiction-day which hits every now and then, and so its relatively easy to not talk about. nonetheless, it is nice to have it as something that you’re aware of and even moreso something you’ve interacted with critically. eventually i’ll get the game of thrones one working and itll be so cool

another small little thought i had: something that i really like about you is how you approach nudity. 

its not a topic that i had put much thought into previously, and definitely not a point of consideration when thinking of a partner, but i just really like the way you do it. i like how when we’re in private theres no questions regardless of the state of we’re in, regardless if one or both of us is fully, partly, or not clothed. i like how regardless of anything, you are always looking to fiddle and fidget in a manner which blurs the lines between platonic and sexual.

when you first told me about how you felt about your room and your space and the safety and comfort of being in it i thought it was an interesting tidbit to learn about you and that i was getting to know you better. later, i started feeling a similar way about your hollows room and then realised that your space feels like that because you make it so. i’d wager that its not the space that brings comfort, but what you, sejal (sejoca), have been able to do with it that makes the cramped dorm room feel so serene. the mattress extended pseudo-full sized bed felt more cosy when were were on it together, and it felt the the most homey when we were on it doing our own things yet still found ourselves in varying degrees of nudity—likely with you playing with your favourite fleshy toy, a cherry on top which convinces me that laundry & taxes will still be fun.

i also love what we’ve done with stickers: to me, it gives our whatsapp chat a similar vibe to what i felt in those moments in your dorm. the strange mix between a platonic ‘sending of a sticker’ and a sexual ‘sending of a nude’ being blurred together. i find it kinda comforting, like as if an artificial boundary imposed by society no longer stands between the two of us and we can do whatever we want in each others presences. hopefully wechat will have them too.

muito amor,
enzu
