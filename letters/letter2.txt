hi sejal, i started drafting this on my phone on the flight back from puerto rico but was, regretfully, caught by you in the act. i think that i would like to use this first real letter to emphasize the joy i feel in this relationship. honestly, i only first started to grasp the magnitude of my emotions in that ever-referenced day where we were watching modern family on the couch of your suite. you were sitting up straight and i was laying on your lap - a position we, regretfully, seldom find ourselves in. i was enjoying the show, in part because it was funny but also because i knew it was one of your favourites and i liked the opportunity to get to know you better, and i got hit like a truck by the sensation of butterflies in my stomach.
